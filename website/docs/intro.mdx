# Introduction

**rise4fun** is a framework to create awesome documentation of programming tools.
The goal of the project is to allow researcher to publish high quality, modern documentation for their tools.

The project is built on top of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) with some [additional Markdown features](/docs/markdown-features).

## Features

-   use best-in-class documentation framework Docusaurus with markdown, live update support
-   privacy compliant, accessible out of the box
-   battery included with [math rendering](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/math-equations), (e.g. $E=mc^2$),
    [diagrams](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/diagrams).

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A-->B;
```

-   execution of tools (and collection of output) at build time
-   live editing of samples for tools that can run in browser
-   automated deployment to GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions
-   documentation edit and preview in GitHub Codespaces

## Examples

Here are projects using these plugins.

## Rise4fun history

Historically, the RiSE published tools through a centralized web site, `https://rise4fun.com/`.
Rise4fun was eventually retired and this effort was put in place to revive the effort.

Although rise4fun is not up anymore, you can see [various videos online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9fwDxZP-0Y) using the interface.

In 2022, our interns [@rlisahuang](https://github.com/rlisahuang) and [@ayanamonr](https://github.com/ayanamonr)
took on reviving the [Z3 guide](https://github.com/microsoft/z3guide) using Docusaurus.

This project is a refactoring and evolution of that work to create a reusable, maintainable framework to build interactive tool
documentation.
