# Deployment

Now that we have a web site running locally, it is time to setup the deployment.

We start by adding a GitHub Action to build and push the compiled web site to the `gh-pages` branch;
then setup the GitHub Pages on the project.

## GitHub Action

Now that you've got the website building locally, it's time to setup a build script in GitHub Actions
to prepare for automatic deployment on every successful commit/build.

Add a root level `package.json` file that declares the `website` folder as a `yarn` workspace (and the `packages` folder).

```json title="package.json"
{
    "private": true,
    "workspaces": ["packages/*", "website"],
    "scripts": {
        "build": "cd website && yarn build"
    }
}
```

Add `.github/workflows/build.yml` to your project

```yml title=".github/workflows/build.yml"
name: Build and Deploy
on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    push:
    pull_request:
jobs:
    build:
        name: Build and Deployment
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
            GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}
            GITHUB_REF: ${{ github.ref }}
            GITHUB_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Cache ris4fun compile code
                id: docusaurus-rise4fun-compile-code
                uses: actions/cache@v3
                with:
                path: website/.docusaurus/docusaurus-remark-plugin-compile-code/
                key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}

            - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
              with:
                  node-version: 18.x
                  cache: yarn
                  cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock

            - name: yarn install
              run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

            - name: Build all
              run: yarn build

            - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
              uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
              if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
              with:
                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                  publish_dir: website/build
                  force_orphan: true
```

Once a build passed, don't forget to enable GitHub Pages in your GitHub repository settings.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository home page and you should see this action running.
Once the run is done, and if everything goes right, the action will upload the compiled web site in the `gh_pages` branch.

## GitHub Pages

Navigate to the **Settings** page, then **Pages** tab, and enable pages from the `gh-pages` branch. This will trigger
a deployment build and your web site should be live within minutes. Yay!

:::tip
Copy the GitHub Pages url and set it as the repository web address.
