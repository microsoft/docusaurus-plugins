# Maintenance

Rise4fun plugins is packaged as npm packages and designed to be updatable. As you maintain your documentation site,
you'll want to follow any **Docusaurus** guidance on update as well.

## Upgrading Docusaurus

Docusaurus typically maintains detailled guides
on how to [migrate versions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/migration).

## Upgrading rise4fun plugins

You can use **yarn** to upgrade the reference to `@microsoft/docusaurus-plugin-rise4fun` to the latest released version.

If you haven't yet, install `npm-check-updates` (`ncu`),

```bash
npm install -g npm-check-updates
```

Run the update script to upgrade @microsoft dependencies.

```bash
ncu -u --filter @microsoft/*
rm yarn.lock
yarn install
```

Once this upgrade is done, make sure to run your build and tests.
