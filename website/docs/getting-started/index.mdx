# Getting Started

Rise4fun leverages [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) along with a few custom plugins.

In this page, we'll show you how to create your first Docusaurus web site and
enable the rise4fun plugins in it.

## Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a framework to build optimized documentation web sites.
It has an extensive documentation which we recommend taking a peek later on. For simplicity,
the installation tutorial is repeated here:

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 18+, open a terminal on your project root
and create a new Docusaurus site:

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest website classic --typescript
```

Try it out! Go to website and start docusaurus.

```bash
cd website
yarn start
```

:::tip

If you are using [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces), add `website` to your workspace list and run `yarn install` again.

:::

## Rise4fun configuration

Let's work on the docusaurus website folder.

```bash
cd website
```

Install the [rise4fun plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/docusaurus-plugin-rise4fun)

```bash
yarn add @microsoft/docusaurus-plugin-rise4fun
```

Open `./docusaurus.config.js` and update it as follows.

```js title="./docusaurus.config.js"
// highlight-next-line
const { configure } = require("@microsoft/docusaurus-plugin-rise4fun");
...
// highlight-next-line
const config = configure(
    {
        ...
}
// highlight-start
    // rise4fun configuration
    , {

})
// highlight-end
```

## Cleanup time!

The default Docusaurus template comes with a lot of content. Make sure to give a pass through `docusaurus.config.js`:

- review the names, url, project name and so forth
- if you don't need a blog, set `blog: false` and delete the `blog` folder
- if you're already familiar with Docusaurus, delete the repopulated content of `docs`

:::note

Microsoft projects: make sure that `organizationName` is set to `microsoft`, to enable automatic legal footer injection

```js title="website/docusaurus.config.js"
const { configure } = require("@microsoft/docusaurus-plugin-rise4fun");
...
const config = configure(
    {
        ...
        // highlight-next-line
        organizationName: "microsoft",
    }
...
```

## Start authoring!

Start the site

```bash
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll see your web site running, yay!

You can learn about the [Markdown features](/docs/markdown-features) available to create your documentation site.
