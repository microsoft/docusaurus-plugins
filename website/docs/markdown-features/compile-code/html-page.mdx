# HTML page

Some tools need to be executed within a browser to work. To support this scenario, rise4fun uses [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)
to launch headless browsers and run the code with it.

This scenario is a bit more involved because it involves sending messages back and forth between the driver and
the script running in the headless browser.

In this example, we create a `echo` tool that copies the capitalized input source
into the output.

```js title="./docusaurus.config.js"
    compileCode: {
        langs: [
        ...,
// highlight-start
        {
            lang: "echo",
            compile: async (source, langOptions) => ({
                code: 0,
                stdout: source.toUppercase(),
            }),
        }
// highlight-end
    ]}
```

Let's take a look at this example in action.

````markdown
```echo
hello
```
````

When rendered in the docs, this snippet looks like any other code snippe.
But you'll also notice an additional box
underneath with the capitalized text.

<BrowserWindow>

```echo
hello
```

</BrowserWindow>
