# HTML page

Some tools need to be executed within a browser to work. To support this scenario, rise4fun uses [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)
to launch headless browsers and run the code with it.

This scenario is a bit more involved because it involves sending messages back and forth between the driver and
the script running in the headless browser.

```js title="./docusaurus.config.js"
    compileCode: {
        langs: [
        ...,
// highlight-start
        {
            lang: "msgl",
            html: "./langs/msagl.html"
        }
// highlight-end
    ]}
```

Let's take a look at this example in action.

````markdown
```msagl
graph G {
    kspacey -- swilliams;
    swilliams -- kbacon;
    bpitt -- kbacon;
    hford -- lwilson;
    lwilson -- kbacon;
}
```
````

When rendered in the docs, this snippet looks like any other code snippe.
But you'll also notice an additional box
underneath with the capitalized text.

<BrowserWindow>

```msagl
graph G {
    kspacey -- swilliams;
    swilliams -- kbacon;
    bpitt -- kbacon;
    hford -- lwilson;
    lwilson -- kbacon;
}
```

</BrowserWindow>
