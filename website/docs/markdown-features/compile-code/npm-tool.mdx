# Tools published on npm

There is a special support for tools that can be installed through `npm`.

Let's take the TypeScript compiler as an example. Add a `compileCode` language entry
that will run all `ts` code section through the `tsc` node executable.

By default, the tool generates a unique folder and write the source as `input.ts`, and the options as `options.json`.
The tool is executed within the generated folder and can tune how your tool is called in the options.

```js title="./docusaurus.config.js"
compileCode: {
    langs: [
        ...,
        // highlight-start
        {
            lang: "ts",
            nodeBin: "tsc",
            inputFiles: {
                "tsconfig.json": {
                    "compilerOptions": {
                        "target": "esnext",
                        "skipLibCheck": true,
                        "lib": ["esnext", "dom"]
                    },
                    "include": [
                        "input.ts"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        // highlight-end
    ];
}
```

Let's take a look at this example in action.

````markdown
```ts showLineNumbers ignoreErrors
console.llog("typo!");
```
````

When rendered in the docs, this snippet looks like any other code snippet. But you'll also notice an additional box
underneath with the TypeScript compiler output. This output was computed at build time.

<BrowserWindow>

```ts showLineNumbers ignoreErrors
console.llog("typo!");
```

</BrowserWindow>
