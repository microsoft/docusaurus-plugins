# Remark plugin code tabs

Groups sequences of code section into a single tabbed element
using [Docusaurus tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs).

## Configuration

This remark plugin is automatically injected by the rise4fun plugins.
If you are providing new language code that are not covered by prims, you can provide map of names.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
const config = configure({
    ...
}, {
    // rise4fun configuration
    ...
    // highlight-start
    codeTabs: {
        languages: {
            yacl: "Yet another cool language"
        }
    }
    // highlight-end
})
```

## Usage

Place code section that need to be group in a sequence,
and add `tabs` to the meta of the first code section.

````markdown
These snippets should be grouped in tabs.

```js tabs
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```
````

### Rendered example

These snippets should be grouped in tabs.

```js tabs
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```

## Grouping

Any paragraph will break the sequence and start a new group.
If you provide a string for `tabs` (`tabs=group`), it will be used as a
custom group sync id.

````markdown
These snippets should be grouped in tabs.

```js tabs=group
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```

Start a new group now.

```js tabs=group
const sub = (a, b) => a - b;
```

```ts
const sub = (a: number, b: number) => a - b;
```
